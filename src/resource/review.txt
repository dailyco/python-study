The film, projected in the form of animation,
imparts the lesson of how wars can be eluded through reasoning and peaceful dialogues,
which eventually paves the path for gaining a fresh perspective on an age-old problem.
The story also happens to centre around two parallel characters, Shundi King and Hundi King,
who are twins, but they constantly fight over unresolved issues planted in their minds
by external forces from within their very own units.
